# Format

- Provide the coach number of the vehicle that is wrapped with an ORAT livery, along with the name (e.g. `11027: Sea Lions`). 
- The name should come from the proclamation in bold font at the top of the vehicle.
  - For example: `Sea Lions` is the title of the livery with the text `Protecting Our Sea Lions, One Ride At A Time`.
- Additional information about the photo the livery consists of may be provided in parentheses where appropriate. 
  - For example, on the top right corner of the left side of bus 11027, there is small text describing the photo: `California Sea Lions, Photo by Frans Lanting`. You may add this information to the title of the livery: `Sea Lions (California Sea Lions) or (California) Sea Lions`; the latter is shorter and preferable.
